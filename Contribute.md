## Contribute to Collegeville 2022

Any member of the computational science and engineering community who has an interest in improving scientific software design is encouraged to submit content to build the program of Collegeville 2022.  

While we welcome any relevant contribution to the software design theme,

**_We are particularly interested in contributions that draw from software design experiences, no matter how formal or informal your design processes are.  Often the structures and dynamics of scientific software design are not clearly documented.  We also are interested in design approaches that address the software ecosystem, in addition to those that address specific software products. We strongly encourage participants to reflect on how their design processes are organized and operate, and submit content for the workshop in any of the formats listed below.  By sharing your design experience, you will help build community awareness about how we can understand and improve scientific software design._**

We also enthusiastically welcome contributions on conceptual models that can help attendees better understand how software design can be improved.  

We welcome the following contributions:

| Contribution| Submission Date | Description                                |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| White paper | June 24 | A brief document articulating impediments, challenges, opportunities or potential solutions in the design of scientific software. **Note:** We have arranged for select authors of white papers to expand their paper as a peer-reviewed article for a special issue of [_Computing in Science and Engineering (CiSE)_](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/cs).  Details available soon.|
| Recorded presentation | June 24 - July 15 | We will accept short recorded presentations on content selected from some of the submitted white papers. If your white paper content would make a good presentation for the workshop, we will contact you to inquire if you are interested in this opportunity. |
| Teatime theme | July 15 |A topic related to software design for open discussion during teatime. If your teatime theme is accepted, you would facilitate a small group discussion on the theme during the July 26 – 28 workshop. |
| Poster        | July 15  |A PDF or interactive webpage that will be the focus of small group discussion during teatime. If your poster is accepted, you would facilitate a small group discussion during the July 26 – 28 workshop.   |
| Watch party | July 15 - 22 | Participants can host a watch party for one or more of the workshop video recordings. Given the increasing number of recorded and available talks online, these watch parties can become regular occasions for sharing recent research and ideas, much like a reading group. More information on watch parties and their post-workshop sustenance is available on [this page](WorkshopResources/WatchParty/WatchPartyList.md). |
| Panelists & Keynote |  July 26 - 28 | During the workshop dates of July 26 – 28, we will host a live keynote and plenary panel discussions with Q&A as the first events each day.  We are limited to just a few panelists and one keynote each day and will invite people based on their white paper submission and the diversity of viewpoint for the theme of the day.  We will contact panelist and keynote candidates to inquire if you are interested in this opportunity. The panel and keynote sessions will be recorded and available after the workshop. |

**All submissions will be reviewed by the organizing committee for possible acceptance to the workshop program**

### White paper guidelines and submission
- Please limit length to 2 - 4 pages standard text (references are not included in page count).
- Your text can address impediments, challenges, opportunities, research directions or potential solutions, or combinations of these aspects.
- Workshop presentations and panelists will in part be drawn from white paper submissions.
- To have your white paper considered for presentation, please submit it no later than **June 24, 2022**.
- In order to assure continued accessibility to workshop content, we are accepting all static contributions as _DOI_ URLs only.  Please use a service such as Figshare or Zenodo (for example) to obtain a DOI. 
- While we accept whitepapers in any format, we encourage you to use the [Computing in Science and Engineering (CiSE) format](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/cs/write-for-us/14597?title=Author%20Information&periodical=Computing%20in%20Science%20%26%20Engineering) if you want your paper to be considered for the CiSE special issue on Scientific Software Design.
- How to submit your white paper:
  - Option 1: Submit a pull request with your DOI. Instructions and current white papers are on **[this page.](https://collegeville.github.io/CW22/WorkshopResources/WhitePapers/WhitePaperList.html)**
  - Option 2: Submit your DOI in an email message to Mike Heroux **<mheroux@csbsju.edu>**.

### Poster guidelines and submission
- Poster sessions will be conducted during teatimes.  We will run discussions concurrently and keep the discussion groups small enough for interactive dialogue.
- Posters can be PDF files of one or a few slides or an interactive webpage.  The intent is to have content that conveys your ideas in a small group dialogue.
- To have your poster considered for presentation, please submit it no later than **July 15, 2022**.
- In order to assure continued accessibility to workshop content, we are accepting all contributions as _DOI_ URLs only.  Please use a service such as Figshare or Zenodo (for example) to obtain a DOI. If you are presenting an interactive poster, please provide its URL.
- How to submit your poster:
  - Option 1: Submit a pull request with your URL. Instructions and current posters are on **[this page.](https://collegeville.github.io/CW22/WorkshopResources/Posters/PosterList.html)**
  - Option 2: Submit your URL via email to Mike Heroux **<mheroux@csbsju.edu>**.

### Teatime theme guidelines and submission
- Teatime is a concept borrowed from Angela Herring: scheduling an open discussion with a small group of people.  
- In order to provide a bit of structure to the discussion, we invite you to submit a teatime theme related to software design.
- If your theme is selected, we will invite you to facilitate a discussion on your theme during the concurrent breakout sessions.
- To have your teatime theme considered for discussion, please submit it no later than **July 15, 2022**.
- How to submit your teatime theme and abstract:
  - Option 1: Submit a pull request. Instructions and current teamtime themes are on **[this page.](https://collegeville.github.io/CW21/WorkshopResources/TeatimeThemes/TeatimeThemeList.html)**
  - Option 2: Submit your teatime theme and abstract in PDF form as an email attachment to Mike Heroux **<mheroux@csbsju.edu>**.

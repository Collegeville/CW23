# Collegeville Workshop Series on Scientific Software

The Collegeville Workshop Series on Scientific Software is intended to bring together three communities of scientific software developers: academia, industry, and laboratories.  While there are certainly existing exchanges between these communities, we are dedicated to improving awareness of common needs, unique contributions and career paths that span these communities.

The first workshop in 2019 focused on software sustainability.  The 2020 workshop focused on developer productivity.  Collegeville 2021 focused on software teams.

The Collegeville 2022 workshop theme is Software Design. In the software engineering community, design is typically considered as the final phase prior to coding the software product. Design involves documenting the structure, function, and interfaces of the software.  

For Collegeville 2022, we will interpret design to mean all pre-coding activities, including requirements gathering and analysis, prototyping and design space exploration.  We use this expanded scope because, in our experience, scientific software teams would be best served to consider all pre-coding activities in aggregate to better prepare for the coding process.

More details about this year's theme can be found on the [**Background Page**](Background.md) when available.
